# House-Sales-Price-Prediction-in-King-County-USA

## Project Description:
In this project, you take on the role of a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. Your primary objective is to determine the market price of houses in King County, USA, given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more. This analysis will aid the Trust in making informed investment decisions in residential real estate.

You will be using a dataset that contains house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, covering homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset includes various attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area size, lot size, number of floors, waterfront view, condition, grade, year built, and renovated, along with latitude and longitude coordinates.

## The project is structured into five modules:

***Importing Data:*** 
Load the necessary libraries and the dataset, and display its structure and data types.

***Data Wrangling:*** 
Clean the data by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns to prepare the dataset for analysis.

***Exploratory Data Analysis:*** 
Generate descriptive statistics and create visualizations to understand the relationships between different variables.

***Model Development:*** 
Develop a linear regression model to predict house prices using the cleaned and processed data.

***Model Evaluation and Refinement:*** 
Evaluate the model using cross-validation techniques and refine it by adding or removing features to improve its performance.


By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling using linear regression. The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable model to predict house prices based on various features, which can be used by the Real Estate Investment Trust to make data-driven investment decisions.

This project involves using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn in Python, and requires basic knowledge of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques.
